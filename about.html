    <h1>MagiDex Story</h1>

    <h2 class="we-are">Who We Are</h2>
    <div class="our-team">
      <p>
        We are a team of 5 developers, by the names of Alex, Michel, Tristian,
        Avery and Eric. Our journey into this space started in a classroom only
        a few weeks ago as students and we’ve been rapidly involving into true
        professionals. We have a variation of knowledge and backgrounds and have
        worked a number of projects and continue enhance our abilities. We all
        have one true combined goal and that's to provide you with the best
        product possible and continue to build it from there. You won’t find a
        better team of gentlemen out there, guaranteed!!
      </p>
      <h2 class="different">Why We Are Different</h2>
      <p>
        In August 2022, after noticing a problem, we started MagiDex to help our
        fellow Magic users to find a simpler way to enter the Magic the
        Gathering scene and learn in a more user-friendly way. We saw firsthand
        how difficult is was to accomplish so, since Monday 8 August 2022 we’ve
        poured every ounce of our blood, sweat, and tears into MagiDex and
        making it simple but enjoyable experience for our users.  We’ve tackled
        big challenges for our users and are constantly making it better. We
        created solutions for learning how to play, getting access/details about
        every card you can imagine, linking our users to the Magi community and
        much more. All so that Magic the Gathering enthusiast like yourself can
        better understand the ins and outs of game and also provide an
        environment where beginners will not feel overwhelmed when stepping into
        scene.  As a result, our work has been recognized by Galvanize as one of
        the best web applications they've ever seen, EVER! We couldn’t be
        prouder to offer you MagiDex and it’s user-friendly interface. We look
        forward to bringing you some high-quality features for years to come!
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="mission">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="about">
      MagiDex is an entertainment company focused on providing high-quality
      content and service to our MagiDex users.  As a company, they wanted to
      change the way entering into the Magic the Gathering scene was done and
      make it more appealing to the audience. In 2022, through research and
      customer feedback they determined that Magic the Gathering is an
      incredibly complex and difficult to learn game and current resources do
      not allow for players looking to enter the scene to have a tool they can
      learn and discover new cards/deck archetypes that is intuitive or
      user-friendly which discourages people from trying in the first place. In
      that moment realized that we had an opportunity to make some major
      enhancements in this space. They decided to create MagiDex to help those
      users and other sites that had the same issues. We believe in MagiDex and
      our commitment to excellence and providing a more pleasant environment for
      the Magic the Gathering community.
