# Description
Website that you can use to Search for old, new edition, banned, rare 'Magic: the gathering' playing cards. You have the ability to search by name, rarity, invocation requirements and many other filters through over 20,000+ playing cards. You can get detailed information on individual cards, download artwork, or simply download a virtual image of the card. This application can help you find out details about a card that may have not been known prior or discover a completely new card to add to the deck, as well as provide helpful resources and information about how to get into the game and start dominating in the gathering fields.

# Problem statement.
- Magic the Gathering is an incredibly complex and difficult to learn game and current resources do not allow for players looking to enter the scene to have a tool they can learn and discover new cards/deck archetypes that is intuitive or user-friendly which discourages people from trying in the first place.
